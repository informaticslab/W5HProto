        This is a proof of concept app that packages an Android Wear app with it.
        The Android Wear version of this app displays a condensed version of the STD Tx Guide
        condition list with one treatment regimen built in (Cervicitis). Swiping right from the
        Cervicitis treatment regimen reveals an \'Open on phone\' option. Clicking \'Open on phone\'
        launches the handheld app directly to the Cervicitis condition details page. The other
        conditions in the wearable app launch dummy sublists to emulate choosing a condition which
        contains subconditions. At this time, no additional functionality is built into those
        conditions. The button below also works to navigate the handheld app to the Cervicitis
        condition details page.
