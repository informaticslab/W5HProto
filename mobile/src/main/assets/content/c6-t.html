        <div class="container"><h3>Diagnostic Considerations</h3>
<p>Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper-genital–tract infection (endometritis), women with a new episode of cervicitis should be assessed for signs of PID and should be tested for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> with a NAAT which can be performed on either vaginal, cervical, or urine samples <sup id="fnref:394"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:394" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (see Chlamydia and Gonorrhea Diagnostic Considerations). Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for the presence of BV and trichomoniasis, and if these are detected, they should be treated. Because the sensitivity of microscopy to detect <em>T. vaginalis</em> is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e., culture, NAAT or other FDA approved diagnostic test) (see Trichomoniasis, Diagnosis). A finding of &gt;10 WBC per high power field in vaginal fluid, in the absence of trichomoniasis, might indicate endocervical inflammation caused specifically by <em>C. trachomatis</em> or <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> <sup id="fnref:488"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:488" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  <sup id="fnref:489"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:489" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e., PCR, culture or serologic testing) for HSV-2 is unknown. FDA-cleared diagnostic tests for <em>M. genitalium</em> are not available.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Several factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g., those aged &lt;25 years and those with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection), especially if follow-up cannot be ensured or if NAAT testing is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should also be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis and Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk of STDs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and NAATs for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> are negative, then a follow-up visit to see if the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.</p>
